## games site update

as you might've seen on the banner of [games.mcalec.dev](https://games.mcalec.dev/) that im moving to a static website.
i will explain in a q&a type questions

## static website?

the static website means that i wont be hosting on Google Sites anymore as it has been frustrating to use.
google sites is kind of a dynamic website since you cant access the code yourself.
i will have a development branch and subdomain with the changes. but until then its still as is.

## what does that mean to me?

all the games and libraries will be the same. the only noticable change will be ui and navigation.
the ui and webpage shouldnt be that hard to navigate (hopefully). that it will different and thats all.

## will there be a new domain?

short words, **no**.
long words, possibly yes. 
i will have the site be on many different subdomains or domains but this will be the main site of the games.

## maybe all?

hopefully thats all (again)  
making final adjustments to this file later on today but should get the word acrooss
