## Hiya all!

it is getting close towards that time of year... the holidays (and christmas). with that i will be inactive on my projects and on discord.
if you ever **need** to contact me, use [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/TTBUATVr4QkAaGKvJVhMf2P225qJbxr44FIzkl19YWBwApJH2eNJYbIt2YCE9Gii).
if you do contact me on discord expect me to respond later.

## furry flare update

its been so great to learn and work on new things on the server. without the support (even a simple thank you) means a lot.
somethings i will be doing later this month or next year (january):
- moving the minecraft server to its own server and getting a hosting provider
- finally fixing up somethings with bots, channels, roles, etc.
- staff rules (it will happen, sorry in advance)
- promoting the yt channel
- above but patreon

i have a todo list on discord but i havent updated it.

this is a good time to copy and paste the annoucement i made about McAlec's Changed Addon [(skip)](#uh-i-forgor)

> ## What happened to the mod?

> In the last month or so I have removed all project files from the CurseForge project. This was due to CurseForge not being as reliable as i thought it would be so I moved to Modrinth. There are many reasons why I stopped developing *McAlec's Changed Addon*. But it was mostly out of the curiosity of making Minecraft modding. I do (in the future) plan on continuing this addon to make it *work*. I cannot guarantee that it would be the best. I used MCreator (a Minecraft modding app) to make this addon. I have some knowledge of Java but not anything about coding Minecraft mods. Some time I'll learn some *actual* Minecraft modding. But in the meantime, I'm learning web development being a data hoarder. I plan on making a blog (post) about this when I get time to create a blog site.

`@mcalec - 12/4/2024 - Changed Addon+`

to add a side note to that; i plan on helping foxyas in helping the beautification of the server. like sorting channels and "giving it color".
i feel like the server itself needs a redo but that might be too much. also i will migrating out of Changed Addon+ discord server.
i deleted the old server due to personal/family issues, but is resolved now. still in making though!

## uh i forgor

hopefully thats all, but as always i will edit when i forget somethin.
have a great christmas, holidays, and new year!
